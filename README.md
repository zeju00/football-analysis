This project is for Data Science course in Korea University at 2024 spring semester. 
The purpose of this project is to define players' individual performance by quantitative statistics. 
At the end of this project, we can simply predict match results for top 10 teams in each league. 
Predicting match result (part 4) was my part of this project, and if you have any question, please contact me. (zeju00@korea.ac.kr)
